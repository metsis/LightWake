# LightWake

IoT-enabled Android app that switches on lights in the bedroom prior to a scheduled alarm.

Android alarm app based largely on Steven Trigg's (www.steventrigg.com) alarm tutorial, but modified and extended here.

Currently interfaces with Spark Core (www.spark.io) through its REST API.
